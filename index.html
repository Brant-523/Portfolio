<p>
  Into the Cosmos Aerospace is a Youtube Channel dedicated to bringing timely and factually accurate Air, Space and Tech News. We have also made it our mission to educate and inspire the next generation of Engineers and Explorers.
</p>
<p> As a part of Into the Cosmos Aerospace I am developing a Thrust Vector Control Rocket. The rocket's main computer is a Teensy 3.2 equipt with a Inertial Processing Unit and servos to move the Solid Rocket Motor to keep the rocket on a preset course. As the project progresses I hope to be able to aquire NAR cerification to fly larger rocket motors and eventually develop a hybrid rocket engine. </p>
