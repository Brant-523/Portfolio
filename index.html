</p></td>
<td><p> As a part of Into the Cosmos Engineering I am developing a <br>
  Thrust Vector Control Rocket. The rocket's main computer is a <br>
  Teensy 3.2 equipt with a Inertial Processing Unit and servos<br>
  to move the Solid Rocket Motor to keep the rocket on a preset course.<br>
  As the project progresses I hope to be able to aquire NAR cerification<br>
  to fly larger rocket motors and eventually develop a hybrid rocket engine. </p>
